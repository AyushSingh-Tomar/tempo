"""Confidence scoring (ADR-004, revised).

Python does the math, the breakdown is retained as evidence, and the AI
bucket stays at its neutral 0.5 default in no-LLM mode.

Revision: the ``relationship`` bucket (no column relationships are defined at
mapping time - the arithmetic check now runs in financial checks, after
treaty figures are entered) and the ``historical`` bucket (no learning from
past manual mappings) were removed and their weight redistributed.

A column whose name is a data-dictionary term for the target field it maps to
is a deterministic, fully-explained match and scores 100% outright
(``EXACT_DICTIONARY_CONFIDENCE``), bypassing the weighted sum.
